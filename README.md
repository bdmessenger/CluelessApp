# Clueless Application
A web application that keeps track of the suspects, weapons, and rooms which you and the other players possess for the board game "Clue." The application can also narrow the items to a suspect, a weapon, and a room. The user can set the number of players and the names for the players in the 'New Game' menu. With local storage, the user can refresh the page without losing data.
